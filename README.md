# CSC382_Spring2019

These projects were built during the spring semester of 2019 for an Analysis of Algorithms course.

## Tech Stack
- C++

### `AverageCase/AverageCase/AverageCase.cpp`
This project consisted of creating a function that calculates the average time to find an element in an array as well as a function that calculates the real time it takes to find the element in the array.

### `Fibonnaci/Fibonnaci/Fibonnaci.cpp`
This project consisted of creating a recursive function and a non-recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci number of an integer and the time required for each function to run.

### `MonteCarlo/MonteCarlo/MonteCarlo.cpp`
This project consisted of comparing the average number of comparisons in Insertion Sort using the Monte Carlo approach to the calculated number of comparisons using a built function.

### `SortComparison/SortComparison/SortComparison.cpp`
This project consisted of comparing the time required for Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort to sort an array.
